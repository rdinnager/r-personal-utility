r-personal-utility
==================

Utility functions I use frequently in R. Just one at the moment:
list\_to\_df: A function to convert a list to a tbl_df object from the `dplyr` package. It was written by Hadley Wickham as a comment on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/aammd/9ae2f5cce9afd799bafb).

More functions will be added as I need them.

Installation:  

```
require(devtools)  
install_github("r-personal-utility", "rdinnager")  
```
